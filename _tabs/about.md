I'm a software engineering student. I love free (as in freedom) software, games, digital art, music, and all that stuff. Work with Java, C and C++, hate php (kinda) and know a little of Bash and Perl. 

In my free time I play games (obviously), make software, sometimes play piano, take photos, or even try to draw on a graphical tablet. Also, I enjoy reading SCP Foundation creepypastas.

Oh, and I'm a furry, if you couldn't tell.
